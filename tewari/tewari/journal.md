* Dispersion needs to be cleaned by trusted miRNAs

# 2019-Jan-31

* Prepare draft in google docs
* Update dispersion figures as measure of reproducibility

# 20018-Sept-10

* Trying to double check by an independet approach sequences detected
  in 4 replicates and 3 labs, are actually the most expressed and robust
* I choose to work only with addition, but the sequence have other isomirs
  as well
* Different visualization to show their absolute and relative expression
* Code to get the matrix that point the the exact sequences
* TODO: work on different types of isomir combinations
* TODO: finilize figures inside report to be ready for presentation
